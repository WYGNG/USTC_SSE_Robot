 TeeChart Pro Activex Control v5 
 v5.0.4.0 Release notes:
=====================================

For information about differences and use of 
TeeChart Pro ActiveX v5 with respect to
TeeChart Pro ActiveX v4 please refer to the 
'Upgrading from TeeChart v4.doc' document 
accessible via the TeeChart Program Manager 
group.

===========================================

Changes for this release:
-------------------------

Bugs resolved:

1. Print Preview from TeeCommander for 
   multi-page Charts in v5.0.3.x functioned
   incorrectly. Now resolved.

2. ZoomPen definition failed to save in tee
   files. Now resolved.

3. Integer overflow error reported after 
   multiple zooms. Now resolved.

4. The property 'Controls' in TeeCommander 
   coincides with a protected word in VBA. 
   To permit access to this functionality 
   in VBA the method has been duplicated 
   with name 'Buttons'.

5. Omission in previous releases, the
   OffsetValues ValueList for Bar3D Series
   is accessible by code for this release.

6. Omission in previous releases, MACD 
   function has new Period3 property.

7. Visual Studio.NET doesn't support the 
   passing as Interface of the Chart to the
   TeePreviewPanel AddChart method. A
   substitute AddChartLink has been added
   for this release to accept ChartLink.

8. The keyword 'Months' as a database field
   name was incompatible with prior 
   translation system for non-english 
   language versions' db access via the 
   Editor. Now resolved.

9. TeePolar/Radar Series problem when 
   labelling datasets of 13, 19, 25, etc.
   values. Internal rounding error resolved.

10.Help button on Chart Editor not 
   functioning. Now resolved.

New features:

1. DeleteRange method added to permit block
   delete of several points from a Series.

2. Custom Axis index now returned from all
   events that return Axis as an integer.

3. Scroll Mousebutton now selectable by code.

4. The TeeChart Utilities folder now includes
   Strong Named DLL assemblies of TeeChart
   and TeeChart with Windows wrapper for use
   with Visual Studio.NET projects that 
   require to be Strong Named.

Changes to note:

1. VC++ developers should note that the location
   of TeeShapePanel's Bevel has been moved to
   TeeCustomShape.

Previous Changes 
(from release v5.0.3 but still noteworthy)

1. Developers upgrading VC++ projects to TeeChart 
   v5.0.3 should note that the Series property has 
   been deprecated to comply with an import 
   restriction to Microsoft's Visual Studio .NET.
   .Net fails to import indexed properties that 
   reside at the root level of an ActiveX Control.
   The property has been replaced by a method of
   the same name. The old Series property has been
   renamed to aSeries but retains its DispId to 
   support existing, non-changed code and already
   compiled applications. When upgrading VC++ 
   classes to the latest version it should suffice
   in all standard cases to change calls of:

     Get_Series

     to
 
     Series 

2. Internet Explorer stopped supporting TeeChart's
   IPersistStream content save from IE v5.5sp2 
   onwards ! TeeChart's persist technique now 
   changed to: first choice IPropertyBag, second 
   choice IPersistStream (used by .NET for example). 
   The changes to TeeChart's persist technique 
   should be transparent and should not cause any 
   inconvenience though you may note the difference 
   on updated Frontpage saved web pages where old
   data content will remain and can be removed 
   manually. The new save format in TeeChart on an 
   HTML page will take the format: 
    
     <param name="Base64" value="..some content..">


===========================================
Key known unresolved issues:

- ChartEditorPanel not supported in MS 
  VC++ applications due to incorrect 
  behaviour of Editor buttons
- Right Axis Arrows click area not located 
  correctly on 3D Charts
- StopMouse not working correctly in
  DBlClick event
- Datasets set via the Chart Editor and requiring
  password access need the 'save password' option
  to be selected in the ADO dialogue. This is not
  a requirement when setting up an ADO connection
  via code.
- Dragdrop events not functioning in .NET.
- Only one TeeChart AX event is triggered, per 
  page, for a WebForm in ASP.Net.
